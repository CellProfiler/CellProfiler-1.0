function HelpOutputFilename

% Naming the output file:
% Type in the text you want to use to name the output file, which is where
% all of the information about the analysis as well as any measurements are
% stored. 'OUT.mat' will be added automatically at the end of whatever you
% type in the box. The file will be saved in the default output directory
% unless you type a full path and file name into the output file name box.
% The path must not have spaces or characters disallowed by your platform.
%
% The program prevents you from entering a name which exists already (when
% 'OUT.mat' is appended). This prevents overwriting an output data file by
% accident, but is also disallowed for the following reason: when a file is
% 'overwritten', instead of completely overwriting the output file,
% MATLAB/CellProfiler just replaces some of the old data with the new data.
% So, if you have an output file with 12 measurements and the new set of
% data has only 4 measurements, saving the output file to the same name
% would produce a file with 12 measurements: the new 4 followed by 8 old
% measurements.


helpdlg(help('HelpOutputFilename'))

% We have one line of actual code in these files so that the help is
% visible. We are not using CPhelpdlg because using helpdlg instead allows
% the help to be accessed from the command line of MATLAB. The one line of
% code in each help file (helpdlg) is never run from inside CP anyway.
