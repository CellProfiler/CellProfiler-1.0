function GSBatchProcessing

% CellProfiler is designed to analyze images in a high-throughput manner.
% Once a pipeline has been established for a set of images, CellProfiler
% can export batches of images to be analyzed on a cluster with the
% pipeline. We often analyze 40,000-130,000 images for one analysis in this
% manner. This is accomplished by breaking the entire set of images into
% separate batches, and then submitting each of these batches as individual
% jobs to a cluster. Each individual batch can be separately analyzed from
% the rest.
%
% There are two methods of processing these batches on a cluster. The first
% requires a MATLAB license for every computing node of the cluster. This
% method produces small MATLAB script files which specify the images to
% analyze. The other method does not require MATLAB licenses for the entire
% cluster, but does require a bit more effort to set up. This method
% produces small MATLAB .mat files which specify the images to analyze.
%
% *************** SETTING UP CLUSTER WITH MATLAB **************************
% Step 1: Create a folder on your cluster for CellProfiler (e.g.
% /home/username/CellProfiler). This folder must be connected to the
% cluster computers' network and readable by all. If you don't know what
% this means, please ask your IT department for help.
%
% Step 2: Copy all CellProfiler source code files into this folder, keeping
% the file structure intact. This version of CellProfiler must be the same
% as the version used to create the pipeline. Sometimes modules are changed
% between versions and this can cause errors.
%
% Step 3: Create batchrun.sh file. This file will allow you to rapidly
% submit jobs to your cluster, rather than you typing out commands one at a
% time to submit jobs individually. There are different software programs
% which control how jobs are submitted to a cluster. The example below is
% for our cluster at the Whitehead Institute which uses LSF software.
% Contact your IT department for help writing a similar file to work with
% your own cluster.
%
% Example (LSF): Open any text editor and copy in the code below, then save
% the file to any directory, usually your home directory is fine. Then
% change the following lines to fit your cluster:
% MATLAB=/SOME_PATH/MATLAB
% LICENSE_SERVER="12345@yourservers.edu"
% Also, you can specify your e-mail address after the bsub command.
% ---
% Note that in the example script below, we had to wrap some lines (marked
% with >>>>>: you should remove the >>> symbols and wrap the line with the
% previous.
% ---
% #!/bin/sh
% if test $# -ne 5; then
%   echo "usage: $0 M_fileDir BatchTxtOutputDir mat_fileDir BatchFilePrefix

% #Note that FOLDERWHEREMATFILESARE is usually the same as
% #FOLDERWHEREMFILESARE. This is mainly if you are trying to re-run failed
% #jobs - it only runs m files if there is no corresponding mat file
% #located in the FOLDERWHEREMATFILESARE.   For example:
% #./batchrun.sh /nfs/sabatini2_ata/PROJECTFOLDER
%>>>>>/nfs/sabatini2_ata/PROJECTFOLDER /nfs/sabatini2_ata/
%>>>>>PROJECTFOLDER Batch_ normal
% # END COPY

% Step 1: Download and install correct version of CPCluster from
% www.cellprofiler.org. If the versions there do not work, it means your
% cluster is running different versions of the operating systems, so you
% will have to download the CPCluster source code and compile it
% specifically for your cluster. This requires a single MATLAB license. For
% more instructions on accomplishing this, see the instructions that are
% downloaded with the CPCluster source code.
%

% ************ SUBMITTING FILES FOR BATCH PROCESSING **********************

% Note that in several steps below, we had to wrap some lines (marked
% with >>>>>: you should remove the >>> symbols and wrap the line with the
% previous.
% ---
% Step 1:
% Create a project folder on your cluster. For high throughput analysis, it
% is a good idea to create a separate project folder for each run. In
% general, we like to name our folders with the following convention:
% 200X_MM_DD_ProjectName. Within this folder, we usually create an "images"
% folder and an "output" folder. We then transfer all of our images to the
% images folder. The output folder is where all of your data will be
% stored. These folders must be connected to the cluster computers network
% and the output folder must be writeable by everyone (or at least your
% cluster) because each of the separate cluster computers will write output
% files in this folder. If you don't know what this means, ask your IT
% department for help. Within the CellProfiler window, set the appropriate
% project folders to be the default image and output folders.
%
% Step 2: Create a pipeline for your image set, testing it on a few example
% images from your image set. In this process, you must be careful to
% consider the worst case scenarios in your images. For instance, some
% images may contain no cells. If this happens, the automatic thresholding
% algorithms will incorrectly choose a very low threshold, and therefore
% 'find' objects which don't exist. This can be overcome by setting a
% 'minimum' threshold in IdentifyPrimAutomatic module.
%
% Step 3: Add the module CreateBatchFiles to the end of your pipeline.
% Please refer to the help for this module to choose the correct settings.
% If you are processing large batches of images, you may also consider
% adding ExportToDatabase to your pipeline, before the CreateBatchFiles
% module. This module will export your data into comma separated values
% format (CSV), and also create a script to import your data into Oracle or
% MySQL databases.
%
% Step 4: Click the Analyze images button. The analysis will begin locally
% processing the first image set. Do not be surprised if processing the
% first image set takes much longer than usual. The first step is to check
% all the images that are present in the images folder - they are not
% opened or loaded, but just checking the presence of all the files takes a
% while. At the end of processing the first cycle locally, the
% CreateBatchFiles module causes local processing to stop and it then
% creates the proper batch files and saves them in the default output
% folder (Step 1). It will also save the necessary data file, which is
% called XXX_data.mat. You are now ready to submit these batch files to the
% cluster to run each of the batches of images on different computers on
% the cluster.
%
% Step 5: Log on to your cluster, and navigate to the directory where you
% have saved the batchrun.sh file (See "Setting Up Cluster For
% CellProfiler"). The usage of batchrun.sh is as follows:
%
% ./batchrun.sh M_fileDir BatchTxtOutputDir mat_fileDir BatchFilePrefix
%>>>>>QueueType
%
% where M_fileDir is the location of the batch files created by
% CreateBatchFiles in step 4, BatchTxtOutputDir is where you want to store
% the txt files which have the output of MATLAB during the analysis
% (includes information like errors and run times), mat_fileDir is the
% folder where XXX_data.mat is located (this file is created in Step 4),
% BatchFilePrefix is the prefix named in CreateBatchFiles (usually Batch_),
% and QueueType is the queue for your cluster. Usually, the first three
% arguments are all the same. Here is an example of how you would submit
% all of your batch files to the cluster:
%
% ./batchrun.sh /Some_Path/200X_XX_XX_ProjectName/output
%>>>>>/Some_Path/200X_XX_XX_ProjectName/output
%>>>>>/Some_Path/200X_XX_XX_ProjectName/output Batch_ normal
%
% In this case, the output folder contains the script files, the
% XXX_data.mat file, and is the folder where we want the txt files with the
% MATLAB output to be written. The prefix is Batch_ so XXX_data.mat is
% actually Batch_data.mat. The queue type is normal, but this is specific
% to your cluster. Ask your IT department what queues are available for
% your use.
%
% Once all the jobs are submitted, the cluster will run each script
% individually and produce a separate output file containing the data for
% that batch of images in the output directory. Then you can decide how to
% access your data. In general, data from large analyses will be loaded
% into a database. Please refer to the ExportToDatabase module for
% information on how to do this. If you have made a very small number of
% measurements, you might be able to use the MergeOutputFiles DataTool, see
% its instructions for further details.
%
% If the batch processing fails for some reason, the handles structure in
% the output file will have a field BatchError, and the error will also be
% written to standard out.  Check the output from the batch processes to
% make sure all batches complete.  Batches that fail for transient reasons
% can be resubmitted.
