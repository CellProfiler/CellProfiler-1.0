% Help for the Identify Primary Yeast Phase module:
% Category: Object Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Identifies yeast in phase contrast images.
% *************************************************************************
%
% Please note: this module is experimental and is probably not yet robust
% for images of varying resolutions/lighting conditions. We have also
% developed a pipeline using the IdentifyPrimAutomatic module for yeast
% phase contrast images which may be a better starting point.
%
% This module has been designed to identify yeast cells in phase contrast
% images. It contains code contributed by Ben Kaufmann of MIT.
%
% Settings:
%
% Size range: You may exclude objects that are smaller or bigger in area than
% the size range you specify. A comma should be placed between the
% lower size limit and the upper size limit. The units here are pixels
% so that it is easy to zoom in on found objects and determine the
% size of what you think should be excluded.
%
% Threshold: The threshold affects the identification of the objects
% in a rather complicated way that will not be decribed here (see the
% code itself). You may enter an absolute number (which may be
% negative or positive - use the image tool 'Show pixel data' to see
% the pixel intensities on the relevant image which is labeled
% "Inverted enhanced contrast image"), or you may have it
% automatically calculated for each image individually by typing 0.
% There are advantages either way.  An absolute number treats every
% image identically, but an automatically calculated threshold is more
% realistic/accurate, though occasionally subject to artifacts.  The
% threshold which is used for each image is recorded as a measurement
% in the output file, so if you find unusual measurements from one of
% your images, you might check whether the automatically calculated
% threshold was unusually high or low compared to the remaining
% images.  When an automatic threshold is selected, it may
% consistently be too stringent or too lenient, so an adjustment
% factor can be entered as well. The number 1 means no adjustment, 0
% to 1 makes the threshold more lenient and greater than 1 (e.g. 1.3)
% makes the threshold more stringent. The minimum allowable threshold
% prevents an unreasonably low threshold from counting noise as
% objects when there are no bright objects in the field of view. This
% is intended for use with automatic thresholding; a number entered
% here will override an absolute threshold. The value -Inf will cause
% the threshold specified either absolutely or automatically to always
% be used; this is recommended for this module.
%
% Minimum possible diameter of a real object: This determines how much
% objects will be eroded. Keep in mind that this should not be set
% very stringently (that is, you should set it to a lower value that
% the real minimum acceptable diameter of an object), because during
% the first thresholding step sometimes objects appear a bit smaller
% than their final, actual size.
%
% Several other variables are ill-defined so far; they were
% empirically determined.  They probably have
% some relationship to the typical object's diameter, but we haven't
% characterized them well yet.....
%
% SmallValue1 LargeValue1:
% Used in this line:   disks=[SmallValue1 LargeValue1];
% These are masks passed over the image to select for objects with a
% radius in the range of SmallValue1-LargeValue1 pixels. These can be thought of as the
% smallest and largest feasible radii
%
% Value2:
% Used in this line:   OrigImageMinima = imopen(BWerode,strel('disk', Value2));
%
% Value3:
% Used in this line:   BWsmoothed  = imclose(BW,strel('disk', Value3));
%
% Value4:
% Used in this line:   PrelimLabelMatrixImage1 = imopen(WS,strel('disk', Value4))
%
% How it works:
% This image analysis module identifies objects by finding peaks in
% intensity, after the image has been blurred to remove texture (based
% on blur radius).  Once a marker for each object has been identified
% in this way, a watershed function identifies the lines between
% objects that are touching each other by looking for the dimmest
% points between them. To identify the edges of non-clumped objects, a
% simple threshold is applied. Objects on the border of the image are
% ignored, and the user can select a size range, outside which objects
% will be ignored.
%
% Special note on saving images: Using the settings in this module, object
% outlines can be passed along to the module Overlay Outlines and then
% saved with the Save Images module. Objects themselves can be passed along
% to the object processing module Convert To Image and then saved with the
% Save Images module. This module produces several additional types of
% objects with names that are automatically passed along with the following
% naming structure: (1) The unedited segmented image, which includes
% objects on the edge of the image and objects that are outside the size
% range, can be saved using the name: UneditedSegmented + whatever you
% called the objects (e.g. UneditedSegmentedNuclei). (2) The segmented
% image which excludes objects smaller than your selected size range can be
% saved using the name: SmallRemovedSegmented + whatever you called the
% objects (e.g. SmallRemovedSegmented Nuclei).
