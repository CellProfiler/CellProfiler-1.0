% Help for the Extract Header Info module:
% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Extracts text info from unusual image format headers.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module was written for an old version of CellProfiler and is
% not functional anymore, but it serves as an example of how to
% extract header info (time, X Y Z location) from an unusual file
% format.  These are images acquired using ISee software from an
% automated microscope.
