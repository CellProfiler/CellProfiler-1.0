% Help for the Stretch, Align, and Crop module:
% Category: Image Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Stretches, aligns, and crops one image relative to another. Useful for
% validation of hand outlined images.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module was written for a specific purpose: to take a larger
% image of the outlines of cells, with some space around the outside,
% and align it with a real image of cells (or of nuclei).
% Fortunately, it can work for almost any set of images for which one
% set is larger than the other and rescaling must be done (and, of
% course, there are features shared which can be used to align the
% images).  Just enter the larger images as the traced ones, and the
% smaller ones as the real images.
%
% This module determines the best alignment of two images.  It expects
% the first to be a scanned, traced transparency of 8 1/2 by 11
% inches, and the second should be a real image from a microscope.
% The addition of colored registration marks is optional, although
% very helpful in alignment.  The module stretches the real image to
% be at the same resolution as the traced image, then creates a black
% background for it of the same size, then aligns the images, and
% finally crops them all to be the same size and taking up the same
% area as on the original real image. In the future, this may be
% developed to include a way of finding the optimal scaling of the
% images to each other; however, no guarantees.
%
% Note that as long as the input real images of nuclei and of cells
% are the same dimensions, their output files will have the same
% dimensions as well.
