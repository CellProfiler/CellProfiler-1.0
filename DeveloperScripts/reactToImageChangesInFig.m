function reactToImageChangesInFig(varargin)
%reactToImageChangesInFig Set up reaction to image changes in a figure.
%   reactToImageChangesInFig(HIMAGE,DELETE_FCN) calls DELETE_FCN if the target
%   image HIMAGE changes in its figure.  DELETE_FCN is a function handle
%   specified by the client that would cause the client or some part of the
%   client to delete itself. HIMAGE can be array of handles to graphics image
%   objects.
%
%   reactToImageChangesInFig(HIMAGE,DELETE_FCN,RECREATE_FCN) calls
%   the DELETE_FCN if the target image HIMAGE is deleted from the figure and
%   calls RECREATE_FCN if a new image is added to that figure.  For example,
%   if a user calls imshow twice on the same figure, the target image HIMAGE
%   is deleted and a new image is added. RECREATE_FCN is a function handle
%   specified by the client that would cause the client or some part of the
%   client to recreate itself.
%
%   Notes
%   -----
%   User has the responsibility to use valid function handles.
%   HIMAGE must be an array of image handles that are in the same figure.
