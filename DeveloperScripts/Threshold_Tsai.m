% Here's the code. I've expanded my analysis to a few more image sets, and it
% still seems to be doing a good job- I was having a bit of a problem with
% false peaks (i.e. a "bumpy" background distribution), but I added a few
% lines of code to deal with that issue. Like I said previously, for images
%     with a really tight background distribution, and then a more spread out
%     foreground distribution, this method appears to give much better results
%     than the metric-based (inter-class variance, entropy, etc.). The exact
%     paper the original algorithm was pulled from is:
% Du-Ming Tsai. A fast thresholding selection procedure for multimodal and
% unimodal histograms. Pattern Recognition Letters 16(6): 653-666 (1995)
%
% I'm happy to give more info on my implementation, and to take any
% suggestions on its further improvement. Like I said, my experience is a
% really nonexistent when it comes to this stuff, so I won't be surprised if
% the algorithm suffers from limited range of application.
%
% When I put it in CPthreshold, I used a secondary function (Tsai.m) to call
% Threshold_Tsai and provide the whole means of dealing with cropped images,
% similar to the existing threshold functions.
%
%
% This thresholding method uses feature extraction from the image histogram
% to set the threshold: it finds the valley between the foreground
% and background disributions, or maximizes a calculated "curvature" in the
% unimodal case.

% According to the algorithm, the histogram is to be smoothed until only 2
% peaks are found (my desired amount). For the sake of keeping from
% smoothing the data -that- much, I'm only going to worry about relatively
% high peaks (say within 20x of max peak, though this parameter can change.)
% I only want to do the above if there are at least 2 peaks in the slighly
% smoothed histogram (in unimodal case, use curvature method)

% Issue #1: sometimes, the background has a multi-peak shape that isn't
% smoothed out, causing a "false" valley that's way up in the background
% region. I'm going to take advantage of the fact that this distribution
% is tighter and higher to differentiate these background peaks.
% Alternatively, I could increase the minimum filter size from 3...
