% Category: Image Tools
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Shows X,Y pixel location and intensity information in the figure window.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This tool shows the pixel intensity at each X,Y location as you hover
% over points within an image. The pixels are displayed via a small box at
% the lower left corner of the figure window. If the image is color (RGB),
% three intensity values are shown: Red, Green, and Blue.
%
% Currently, it can also measure lengths if you click the mouse at a
% starting point and hold the button down while dragging, although this
% could also be done with the Measure Length tool, accessible by clicking
% on the image of interest and choosing Measure Length from the resulting
% Image Tool window.
%
% To exit the tool, click the 'x' in the pixel intensity information panel.
