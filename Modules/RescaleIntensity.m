function handles = RescaleIntensity(handles)

% Help for the Rescale Intensity module:
% Category: Image Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Changes intensity range of an image to desired specifications.
% *************************************************************************
%
% The intensity of the incoming images are rescaled by one of several
% methods. This is especially helpful for converting 12-bit images saved in
% 16-bit format to the correct range (see method E).
%
% Settings:
%
% Rescaling method:
% (S) Stretch the image so that the minimum is zero and the maximum is
% one.
%
% (E) Enter the minimum and maximum values of the original image and the
% desired resulting image. Pixels are scaled from their user-specified
% original range to a new user-specified range.  If the user enters "AE"
% (Automatic for Each), then the highest and lowest pixel values will be
% Automatically computed for each image by taking the maximum and minimum
% pixel values in each image.  If the user enters "AA" (Automatic for All),
% then the highest and/or lowest pixel values will be Automatically computed
% by taking the maximum and minimum pixel values in all the images in the
% set.
%
% The user also has the option of selecting the values that pixels
% outside the original min/max range are set to, by entering numbers in
% the "For pixels above/below the chosen value..." boxes. If you want
% these pixels to be set to the highest/lowest rescaled intensity values,
% enter the same number in these boxes as was entered in the highest/lowest
% rescaled intensity boxes. However, using other values permits a simple form of
% thresholding (e.g., setting the upper bounding value to 0 can be used for
% removing bright pixels above a specified value)
%
% To convert 12-bit images saved in 16-bit format to the correct
% range, use the settings 0, 0.0625, 0, 1, 0, 1.  The value 0.0625 is equivalent
% to 2^12 divided by 2^16, so it will convert a 16 bit image containing
% only 12 bits of data to the proper range.
%
% (G) Rescale the image so that all pixels are equal to or greater
% than one.
%
% (M) Match the maximum of one image to the maximum of another.
%
% (C) Convert to 8 bit: Images in CellProfiler are normally stored as
% numerical class double in the range of 0 to 1. This option converts these
% images to class uint8, meaning an 8 bit integer in the range of 0 to 255.
% This is useful to reduce the amount of memory required to store the
% image. Warning: Most CellProfiler modules require the incoming image to
% be in the standard 0 to 1 range, so this conversion may cause downstream
% modules to behave unexpectedly.
%
% (T) Text: rescale by dividing by a value loaded from a text file with LoadText.

%%% VARIABLES %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% New Settings for PyCP
% In general, this module is very confusing with the (Method E only) and
% (Method T) only etc qualifiers.  In the PyCp version, it would be great
% if the (Method E only) variables only became visible once the user had
% selected method E.
%
% While I like the that Var 3 explains to the user (briefly) what each
% method does, in most modules we leave this explanation to the help to
% avoid overly long variable settings. (Think: IdPrimAuto etc)  I think it
% is fine to do the same and change Var 3 to: 'Which rescaling method
% do you want to use?'  If it is possible, perhaps the user could mouse
% over the choice and see a brief explanation? Anne 3-26-09: Yes, I think that
% we can get away with a simple dropdown menu, with the existing choices
% expanded on slightly (and additional explanation in the help or when
% further options are presented for the particular choice that's made):
%
% -Stretch each image to use the full intensity range
% -Choose specific values to be re-set to the full intensity range
% -Divide by the image's minimum so that all pixels are equal to or greater than 1
% -Match the image's maximum to another image's maximum
% -Convert to 8 bit
% -Divide each image by the same value ([Note: this new option should let
% you just enter a number])
% -Divide each image by a previously calculated value ([note: for this one, once you
% choose this, the question should be something like "What did you call the
% numbers that you want to divide each image by? You should calculate one
% number per image in advance and load the numbers with the LoadText
% module.])
%
% Vars 4&5:  This is suited to a dropdown menu, like this:
% What is the intensity value in the input image that will be set to the
% lowest value in the rescaled image?
% - Automatically calculate based on all images
% - Automatically calculate based on each image independently
% - Specify a value...
% If Python allows, in this and other 'popupcustom'-type cases, I almost
% think it is most obvious to leave a blank textbox for editing, rather
% than forcing the user to click 'specify a value' and then enter a value
% (since it may not be inherently obvious you can enter your own value?)
%
% Vars 6-9: If it's possible, condense these variables into just two:
% Var 6: Map low intensity or negative pixels from the original image to this value: (default 0)
% Var 7: Map high intensity or >1 pixels from the original image to this value: (default 1)
% I can't think of a case where you would want these to be different
% values??  I'm not sure if this is the correct way to re-word these
% variables, but I don't think they are very clear how they are presented
% now. Anne 3-26-09: I agree it sounds strange, but there *was* a case
% where we needed to do this (can't remember why; I think there was
% supr-bright artifactual schmutz that we wanted to set to 0).  Lee,
% perhaps you can think this over a bit - presumably someone could put a
% few modules in order to carry out a weird case like that?  Also, how
% should this module relate to ApplyThreshold... it sounds like this module
% is partly doing that function. This will require a bit of thinking to
% figure out where these functionalities ought to be.
