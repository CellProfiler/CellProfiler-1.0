% Help for the Identify Primary LoG module:
% Category: Object Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
%
% Identifies the centers of blob-like primary objects.  The result
% consists of only a single pixel per object, located near the center
% of the object.
%
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module identifies the centers of blob-like primary objects
% (e.g. nuclei) in grayscale images that show bright objects on a dark
% background.  When the objects of interest are fairly round and of
% even size, this module may be more sensitive than the methods in
% IdentifyPrimAutomatic and therefore detect objects that would
% otherwise be lost.
% 
% The result consists of only a single pixel per object, located near
% the center of the object; the IdentifySecondary module can be used
% to fill out the object based on this center point.
%
% SETTINGS:
%
% The radius parameter should be set to the approximate radius of the
% objects of interest.  The algorithm is not very sensitive to this
% parameter.
%
% The threshold parameter informs the algorithm how inclusive to be when
% looking for objects.  Internally, each potential object is assigned
% a score that depends on both how bright the object is and how
% blob-like its shape is.  Only objects that score above the threshold
% are returned.  If the thresold is too high, objects will be lost; 
% if it is too low, spurious objects will be found. The threshold 
% can be determined experimentally, but the 'Automatic' setting 
% will make a guess using RobustBackground Global's thresholding 
% method on the transformed image.  RobustBackground is useful because it
% makes little assumption of the intensity histogram, and thus 
% can be protective against out-of-focus or empty images.  If you want the 
% threshold to be consistent across images, then you can use the threshold found by 
% the 'Automatic' setting as a starting point for manual threshold input adjustment.
% Also, if the threshold is consistently high or low, then you can adjust 
% by a multiplicative correction factor by inserting it after a comma, e.g.
% "Automatic,1.5". 
%
% ALGORITHM DETAILS:
%
% The module works by convolving the image with the Laplacian of
% Gaussian (LoG) kernel.  This is equivalent to convolving with the
% Gaussian kernel and then with the Laplace operator.  The regional
% maxima in the filter response that exceed the specificed threshold
% are identified as objects.  The radius parameter specifies the width
% of the kernel.
%
% Ultimately, this module will become an option in
% IdentifyPrimAutomatic, so that its options for maxima suppression
% and finding edges between clumps can be used.

% Notes for PyCP
%
% FROM CP ToDo:
% Anne 2008_01_30: Merge IdentifyPrimaryLoG into the regular IdentifyPrimAutomatic module. 
% In particular, be sure that the help describes under what conditions the different options 
% are useful. Think carefully about how to add the variable that is LoG-specific to the module.
%
% Anne 2008_05_12: Describe what the LoG is doing - we think that we are looking for 
% minima (or maxima) of the LoG which makes it a maxima-minima finder of the original image, 
% whereas many people look for zero crossings of the LoG which would be using it as an edge 
% detector. Is that right?
%
% David 2009_04_17:  As the above older comments say, this module should be integrated into
% IDPrimAuto.  However, this ID module is different than other primary segmentation modules
% in that it only finds the center pixel of objects and must utilize a subsequent IDSecondary 
% after to grow objects.  So we either:
% (1) Treat LoG as a special thresholding method that only ouputs single pixel objects
% or
% (2) Treat LoG as a declumping method.  In this case, another thresholding method would define 
% foreground/background, and LoG would find single pixels within the foreground.
% 
% In either case, we would need to decide whether we automatically apply a watershed/propagation
% after the initial single-pixel finding method.  I prefer (2) above and would opt for
% automatically propagating the single-pixels within the foreground objects, since that is almost 
% always done anyway, and would save the step of adding an IDSecondary.
%
% Settings:
% The first two settings map obviously.
% The diameter parameter is only single, so that if LoG is chosen, one of the diameter boxes 
% should gray-out.
% The threshold parameter is very sensitive, and the user was blind to what this should be at first,
% so the 'Automatic' threshold was added recently to use Otsu to guess.  This functionality would be
% equivalent to the 'Automatic' setting in the existing declumping settings.
