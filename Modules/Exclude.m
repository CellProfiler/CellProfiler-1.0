% Help for the Exclude Objects module:
% Category: Object Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Removes objects outside of specified region.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This image analysis module allows you to delete the objects and portions
% of objects that are outside of a region you specify (e.g. nuclei outside
% of a tissue region).  The objects and the region should both result from
% any Identify module (Primary, Secondary, or Tertiary).
%
% Retain or renumber:
% Retaining objects' original numbers might be important if you intend to
% correlate measurements made on the remaining objects with measurements
% made on the original objects. Note that retaining original numbers will
% produce gaps in the numbered list of objects (since some objects no
% longer exist). This may cause errors with certain exporting tools or with
% downstream modules that expect object numbers to not have gaps.
% Renumbering, on the other hand, makes the output file more compact, the
% processing quicker, and is also guaranteed to work with exporting and
% data analysis tools.
%
% Special note on saving images: Using the settings in this module, object
% outlines can be passed along to the module Overlay Outlines and then
% saved with the Save Images module. Objects themselves can be passed along
% to the object processing module Convert To Image and then saved with the
% Save Images module. This module produces several additional types of
% objects with names that are automatically passed along with the following
% naming structure: (1) The unedited segmented image, which includes
% objects on the edge of the image and objects that are outside the size
% range, can be saved using the name: UneditedSegmented + whatever you
% called the objects (e.g. UneditedSegmentedNuclei). (2) The segmented
% image which excludes objects smaller than your selected size range can be
% saved using the name: SmallRemovedSegmented + whatever you called the
% objects (e.g. SmallRemovedSegmented Nuclei).
%
% Another note on filtering objects: The Exclude module will not exclude
% whole objects that are overlapping with the specified region. To handle
% this, you can convert the region to a binary image, then use
% MeasureObjectIntensity on the objects but based on the binary image. This
% will essentially count the number of region pixels within each object,
% which will be non-zero if there is any overlap of the object with the
% region of interest. Using FilterByObjectMeasurement based on a fraction
% of the integrated intensity can then be applied to exclude overlapping
% objects. We will probably include this procedure as an option in the
% next release.

% MBray 2009_04_17: Comments on variables for pyCP upgrade
% Recommended variable order (setting, followed by current variable in MATLAB CP)
% (1) What did you call the object you want to filter? (ObjectName)
% (2) Which object defines the region outside of which exclusion should
%   occur? (MaskRegionName)
% (3) What do you want to call the objects that remain after exclusion?
%   (RemainingObjectName)
% (4) For the remaining objects, do you want to retain their original
%   object label or renumber them consecutively? (Renumber)
% (5) What do you want to call the outlines of the remaining objects? Type
%   "Do not use" to ignore. (SaveOutlines)
% (6a) Should objects partially overlapping with the exclusion region be
%   removed? (RemoveOverlapping)
% (6b) (If "Yes" to above) What is the minimum percentage of the object
%   that should be overlapping in order to exclude it?
