% MBray 2009_03_20: Comments on variables for pyCP upgrade
% If debugging/history is implemented in pyCP, this module will probably be
% removed.
% Anne 4-9-09: Anne votes that we should keep this module. It is
% pretty simple, and the person might want to save the pausing in the
% pipeline itself (for re-loading later) whereas debugging marks are
% session-specific. It might be rare that someone really uses this module
% but it doesn't hurt to make it available because it doesn't clutter very
% much and has a clear purpose/name.

%textVAR01 = This module pauses CellProfiler until the dialog box is clicked.  The SKIP setting is useful when testing your pipeline, so that you can leave subsequent modules (e.g. CreateBatchFiles or Export modules) in place while testing. The CONTINUE setting ignores the module entirely.

%textVAR02 = Do you want to pause here (PAUSE), skip subsequent modules (SKIP), or continue without prompting (CONTINUE)?
%choiceVAR02 = Pause
%choiceVAR02 = Skip
%choiceVAR02 = Continue
SkipChoice = char(handles.Settings.VariableValues{CurrentModuleNum,2});

%%% The figure window display is unnecessary for this module, so the figure
