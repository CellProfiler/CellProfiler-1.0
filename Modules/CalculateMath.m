% Help for the Calculate Math module:
% Category: Measurement
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% This module can take measurements produced by previous modules and
% performs basic arithmetic operations.
% *************************************************************************
%
% The arithmetic operations available in this module include addition,
% subtraction, multiplication and division. The operation can be chosen
% by adjusting the operations setting. The resulting data can also be
% logged or raised to a power. This data can then be used in other
% calculations and can be used in Classify Objects.
%
% This module currently works on an object-by-object basis (it calculates
% the requested operation for each object) but can also apply the operation
% for measurements made for entire images.
%
% Feature Number:
% The feature number specifies which features from the Measure module(s)
% will be used for the operation. See each Measure module's help for the
% numbered list of the features measured by that module.
%
% Saving:
% The math measurements are stored as 'Math_...'. If both measures are
% image-based, then a single calculation (per cycle) will be stored as 'Image' data.
% If one measure is object-based and one image-based, then the calculations will
% be stored associated with the object, one calculation per object.  If both are
% objects, then the calculations are stored with both objects.
%
% Category: 'Math'
% Features measured:                         Feature Number:
% (As named in module's last setting)     |       1
%
% Note: If you want to use the output of this module in a subsequesnt
% calculation, we suggest you specify the output name rather than use
% Automatic naming.

% MBray 2009_03_20: Comments on variables for pyCP upgrade
%
% Recommended variable order (setting, followed by current variable in MATLAB CP)
% (1) What do you want to call the measurement calculated by this module? (OutputFeatureName)
% (2) What operation would you like to perform? (Operation)
% (do we currently allow 'raise to a power' here?)
% Perhaps show settings for the operands in two columns (eg, numerator settings on
% left, denominator settings on right). Maybe show mathematical symbol (based on answer
% to (2)) between the columns. Or, if this is too time-consuming, at least
% show, based on the selection in (2), which operand is which. In other
% words, if they choose Division, then show: Operand 1/operand 2. If they
% choose subtraction, show: operand 1 - operand 2.
%
% (2.5) What type of number is the first operand?
% CHOICES: (a) measurement of an individual object, (b) measurement from a whole
% image, (c) number
% If they choose (a) then provide the list of objects, if (b) then list of
% images, if (c) then provide an edit box for them to enter something. This
% new ability to calculate per-image features or enter numbers then affects
% the rest of the questions below (they are currently written for
% per-object measurements, but hopefully it's clear how to adjust them for
% per-image measurements or for a number the user specifies):
%
% (3a) Which object's measurement would you like to use as the first operand? (ObjectName{1})
% (3b) What is the measurement category? (Category{1})
% (3c) What is the measurement feature? (FeatureNumber{1})
% (3d) (If the answer to (3c) involves a scale) What scale was used to
%      calculate the feature? (SizeScale{1})
%      (If the answer to (3c) involves an image) What image was used to
%      calculate the feature? (ImageName{1})
% (3e) What number would you like to multiply the operand by?  (MultiplyFactor1)
% (3f) What power would you like to raise the operand to? (this feature
% currently doesn't exist; should we ask the user what operation they want
% to perform on the first operand prior to calculating with the second
% operand, then offer multiply, raise to a power, and perhaps other
% options? or is this just getting way too confusing?)
%
%
% (3.5) Again, insert "what type of number is the second operand?"
%
% (4a) Which object's measurement would you like to use as the second operand? (ObjectName{2})
% (4b) What is the measurement category? (Category{2})
% (4c) What is the measurement feature? (FeatureNumber{2})
% (4d) (If the answer to (4c) involves a scale) What scale was used to
%      calculate the feature? (SizeScale{2})
%      (If the answer to (4c) involves an image) What image was used to
%      calculate the feature? (ImageName{2})
% (4e) What number would you like to multiply the operand by? (MultiplyFactor2)
% (4f) What power would you like to raise the operand to? (this feature
% currently doesn't exist)
%
% question: should we allow the user to choose additional operands (perhaps just for
% addition and multiplication) or just let them use an additional
% CalculateMath module in the pipeline for that sort of thing? I think the
% latter would be fine, especially if it keeps this module from ending up
% being confusing.
%
% Note: we could eliminate the next two questions because the user could
% just put an additional CalculateMath module in the pipeline, right?
% (5a) What power would you like to raise the result to? (Power)
% (5b) What number would you like to multiply the above result by? (MultiplyFactor3)
%
% NOTES:
% (i) Setting (1) should not have an automatic option; the user should
% specify the name explicitly. (Anne says: why not, Mark? Do we tend to run
% into trouble with the name being too long? If so, then this makes sense.
% We should make sure then, that the custom-entered feature name is
% choosable in other drop down menus downstream in the pipeline - I think
% we have a 'custom' measurement type.)
% (ii) Measurement category/feature/image/scale settings should only be shown if
% the measurement hierarchy requires it.
% (iii) Some clarification will be needed to show the order of operations to
% the user
