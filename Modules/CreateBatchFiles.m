% Help for the Create Batch Files module:
% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Produces text files which allow individual batches of images to be
% processed separately on a cluster of computers.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module creates a set of files that can be submitted in parallel to a
% cluster for faster processing. This module should be placed at the end of
% an image processing pipeline.
%
% Before using this module, you should read Help -> General Help ->
% Batch Processing. That help file also will instruct you on how to
% run the batch files that are created by this module.
%
% Settings:
% PATH TO BATCH_DATA.MAT FILE:
% Choose either the Default Output Folder (".") or a path relative to it,
%   e.g. "./SaveToThisFolder"
%
% Other Paths: The last two settings allow changing the paths between
% local and cluster computers. For example, when starting with a local PC
% computer and setting a batch to run on a Linux-based cluster, 
% the path may be essentially the same except the first notation:
%
% PC:    \\remoteserver1\cluster\project
% Linux: /remoteserver2/cluster/project
%
% In this case, for the local machine you would type "\\remoteserver1" and
% for the remote machine you would type "/remoteserver2". As of now, this
% is hardcoded to always use Linux and Macintosh style slashes (/).
%
% If your input image folder and output folder are located on different 
% machines, you can specify the input image paths followed by the output 
% path separated by a comma.
%
% Note: This module produces a Batch_data.mat file. This contains the
% first image set's measurements plus information about the processing
% that each batch file needs access to in order to initialize the
% processing.  See the BatchRunner.py, CPCluster.py, and CPCluster.m
% files for how this information is used.  As many clusters use
% different configurations for batch control, compiled versus
% interpreted Matlab, access paths, etc. it will probably be necessary
% to use those files as guides for a locally customized solution.
% BatchRunner.py requires Python 2.5.2 and the module scipy 0.6 to be installed.

% Notes for pyCP:
% The First setting stays the same, except that perhaps the "Use . to specify
% default" is replaced with some GUI element that lets you choose "Use
% default output folder" from a dropdown menu rather than typing an arbitrary period.
%
% The second and third settings are translations from local-to-cluster nomenclature.
% They are notorious for tripping up users, so clarification would be
% useful. First thing is that we should ask whether the local and cluster
% machines use the same pathnames (or something like that) and skip the
% rest if the answer is Yes.
% The questions have 1 or 2 inputs, for default image and ouput folders, but this 
% should be more explicit.  And it's possible that more than 2 translations 
% could be necessary (if images were on two different servers and the output was
% on a third), so there should be no limitation on the number of translations.  
% It would be nice if initially two boxes were presented
% on the left and right that were labeled LOCAL ROOT PATH and CLUSTER ROOT PATH.  A button 
% labeled "Do you want to add another set of paths?", if clicked, would display another pair 
% of text boxes below the first set, to be filled in.  
% Further, it would be good (if possible) to show an example fully-constructed 
% path as the user types in the root path. 
% Maybe pie-in-the-sky, but a test mode would be really cool, 
% to make a simple (webserver?) call to see if the cluster's path existed, 
% which would head off a lot of errors.  We should also prevent PC users from 
% entering UNC paths ('\\...') and stick to mapped drives (or pick one), since 
% we don't want to map all possible network naming schemes.
