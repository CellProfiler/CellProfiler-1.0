function handles = LoadText(handles)

% Help for the Load Text module:
% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Loads text information corresponding to images. This data (e.g. gene
% names or sample numbers) can be displayed on a grid or exported with the
% measurements to help track samples.
% *************************************************************************
%
% Use this tool to load in text information. This is useful for two
% reasons:
% 1. Some modules, like DisplayGridInfo, place text information onto
% images. In this case, the number of text entries that you load with this
% module must be identical to the number of grid locations.
% 2. If the number of text entries that you load with this module is
% identical to the number of cycles you are processing, the text
% information you load will be placed in the output files alongside the
% measurements that are made. Therefore, the information will be exported
% with the measurements when you use the ExportData data tool, helping you
% to keep track of your samples. If you forget this module, you can also
% run the AddData data tool after processing is complete; its function is
% the same for this purpose.
%
% The text information to be loaded must be in a separate text file with
% the following syntax:
%
% DESCRIPTION <description>
% <Text info 1>
% <Text info 2>
% <Text info 3>
%              .
%              .
%
% <description> is a description of the text information stored in the
% file. It can contain spaces or unusual characters.
%
% For example:
%
% DESCRIPTION Gene names
% Gene X
% Gene Y
% Gene Z
%
% Be sure that the file is saved in plain text format (.txt), not Rich Text
% Format (.rtf).
%
% Path Name:
% Type period (.) for the default image folder, or ampersand (&) for the
% default output folder.
% NOTE: this nomenclature is opposite that in SaveImages for historical purposes.

%%% VARIABLES %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Variable settings for PyCP
% For exporting to database, right now ExportToDatabase assumes that
% anything loaded by load text is actually a number (so its a float) as
% opposed to a character.  Perhaps in LoadText, we could ask the user what
% they are loading- characters or numbers- and store this info (in the name
% of the loaded text? LoadedText_Char vs LoadedText_Float?) so that
% downstream modules who care can access it.  I'm guessing right now Calc.
% Stats. assumes you're giving it numbers (doses) but in theory you could
% group over any treatment and come up with stats for those, I think.
%
% Getting even more abstract about metadata, Could it be possible to load
% in your metadata w/ load text modules and have ExportToDatabase create a
% metadata table? (On the most basic level, it could just assume that
% whatever you loaded in loadtext is metadata, and created a table linked
% by image number, just with the loaded text in a separate table)
%
% I can't think of any other uses of LoadText, other than metadata, but we
% should think about what users may do with LoadText and keep it flexible
% for that too.
%
% Anne 4-9-09: I think perhaps this module should be LoadData instead of
% LoadText, since the latter implies that numbers can't be loaded. I agree
% with what Kate says above; overall this module should allow you to
% import a text file but also a tab delimited and comma delimited file. I'm
% not sure how best to handle the number vs. character issue - the options
% are asking the user, figuring it out ourselves, or requiring that the
% user put a label at the top of each column indicating numbers or
% characters.  See also the AddData data tool and Calculate Statistics
% (which relies on the input from this module).
