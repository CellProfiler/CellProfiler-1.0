% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Makes a projection either by averaging or taking the maximum pixel value
% at each pixel position of a number of images organized by directory
%
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module combines a set of images by averaging or by taking the maximum
% pixel intensity at each pixel position. When this module is used to
% average a Z-stack (3-D image stack), this process is known as making
% a projection.
%
% Settings:
%
% * Enter the pathname to the folders containing the images:
%   This is the base directory that contains each of the directories
%   to be combined into a projection. Relative paths are from the image
%   folder: for instance "." operates on the directories in the image folder.
%
% * Enter the text that the folders have in common:
%   Enter some portion of the directory name that's common to all
%   directories for this type of image. For instance, "DNA-A01" and
%   "DNA-A02" can be selected by entering "DNA". Enter "*" to take all
%   directories.
%
% * Analyze all subfolders within each folder:
%   If yes, the module will read image files in subfolders of each
%   folder it looks at. If no, it will only read image files out of
%   the named folder.
%
% * How do you want to load these files:
%   Exact match - if the text below matches some part of the text in the
%                 image file name, the file will be accepted.
%   Regular expressions - use a regular expression to match the image
%                         file name (see LoadImages for details).
%
% * What kind of projection would you like to make?:
%   If you choose Average, the average pixel intensity at each pixel
%   position will be used to created the final image.  If you choose
%   Maximum, the maximum pixel value at each pixel position will be used to
%   created the final image.
% * What do you want to call the projected image?:
%   Give a name to the resulting image, which could be used in subsequent
%   modules.
%
% Measurements:
% Image / DirectoryName - the name of the directory from which we took
%                         the image files for this image
%       / PathName      - the path to that directory

[CurrentModule, CurrentModuleNum, ModuleName] = CPwhichmodule(handles);

%Klmadden 2009_03_20 For variable 1, it should be clear that this is one
%level ABOVE the the directory you would like to load in as a projection, for ex:
% Enter the pathname where the directory you are loading is located
% For variable 4/5, it should be clear that you are now referring to which
% files within these directories you want to load
% Var 7 should be :
% Would you like to check images for a QCFlag (loaded earler in a load text
% module) and bypass images possessing a flag in making the projection?
% I think maybe 'What do you want to call the projected image?' should be
% moved ahead of all the QCFlag stuff, so if you're not checking for a
% QCFlag you dont miss it
% Also, it would be nice if in the PyCP version, the QCFlag options about
% number of channels, etc only appeared to the user if they select 'yes'
% for 'Do you want to check for a QCFlag' instead of being qualified by
% 'this is only used for qcflag = YES' at the end.
%
% Mbray 2009_04_17: Variable comments
% I think this module is two in one, a combination of LoadImages and
% MakeProjection. The functionality which allows groups of images to be
% created should be part of LoadImages, and the ability to aggregate images
% should be part of MakeProjection. The one unique function it can add is
% the QC flag portion, which might be part of LoadImages? In any case, this
% module should probably disappear.
