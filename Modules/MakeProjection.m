% Help for the Average module:
% Category: Image Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Makes a projection either by averaging or taking the maximum pixel value
% at each pixel position.
%
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module averages a set of images by averaging the pixel intensities
% at each pixel position. When this module is used to average a Z-stack
% (3-D image stack), this process is known as making a projection.
%
% Settings:
%
% * What did you call the images to be made into a projection?:
%   Choose an image from among those loaded by a module or created by the
% pipeline, which will be made into a projection with the corresponding images of every
% image set.
%
% * What kind of projection would you like to make?:
%   If you choose Average, the average pixel intensity at each pixel
%   position will be used to created the final image.  If you choose
%   Maximum, the maximum pixel value at each pixel position will be used to
%   created the final image.
% * What do you want to call the projected image?:
%   Give a name to the resulting image, which could be used in subsequent
% modules. See the next setting for restrictions.
%
% * Are the images you want to use to be loaded straight from a Load Images
% module, or are they being produced by the pipeline?:
%   If you choose Load Images Module, the module will calculate the single,
% projected image the first time through the pipeline (i.e. for cycle 1) by
% loading the image of the type specified above of every image set.
% It is then acceptable to use the resulting image
% later in the pipeline. Subsequent runs through the pipeline (i.e. for
% cycle 2 through the end) produce no new results. The projcted image
% calculated during the first cycle is still available to other modules
% during subsequent cycles.
%   If you choose Pipeline, the module will calculate the single, projected
% image during the last cycle of the pipeline. This is because it must wait
% for preceding modules in the pipeline to produce their results before it
% can calculate an projected image. For example, you cannot calculate the
% projection of all Cropped images until after the last image cycle completes
% and the last cropped image is produced. Note that in this mode, the
% resulting projected image will not be available until the last cycle has
% been processed, so the projected image it produces cannot be used in
% subsequent modules unless they are instructed to wait until the last
% cycle.

%%% VARIABLES %%%

% PyCP notes: The 4th variable is basically asking whether you want to do
% this calculation during the first cycle (in which case the resulting
% image will be available downstream in the pipeline) or whether you need
% to let other processing proceed cycle-by-cycle in order to gather the raw
% material for this module to do its thing, thus producing the final image
% only at the end of the last cycle. So this should be more clear because
% right now it seems like a weird question to ask the user where their
% images are coming from - of course in the new PyCP we could just figure
% this out automatically probably, but that's not exactly the point of the
% question.
