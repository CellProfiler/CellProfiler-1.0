Version 1.0.5811
--New functionality
RunMuliplePipelines - Allows sequential execution of any/all pipelines located in a directory, including subdirectories. Pipelines are identified as .mat files with the identifier "PIPE" in the name. This function is located in the main toolbar under "File"

--New modules
CalculateImageOverlap - Compares two binary images for overlap.
ImageMath - Performs simple mathematical operations on image intensities.
LabelImages - Labels images by assigning them a row and column annotation based on a plate layout.
MeasureRadialDistribution - Measures the radial distribution of staining intensity on a per-object basis.
Multiply -This module multiplies two images.
MeasureImageQuality - Formerly known as MeasureImageSaturationandBlur
UnifyObjects - Relabels objects so that objects within a specified distance of each other get the same label and thereby become the same object 
Note: The UnifyObjects module was listed in the previous release but not accessible by users

--Modified Modules
The following modules had changes in their settings. Old settings will automatically be updated to the new version when a pipeline is loaded.
ExportToDatabase
SaveImages
RescaleIntensity

The following modules had major variable description changes.  Settings loaded from modules created with older versions will need to be updated manually:
ClassifyObjectsByTwoMeasurements
FilterbyObjectMeasurements
CalculateMath
CreatBatchFiles
GroupMovieFrames
Align
MaskImage
ClassifyObjects
CalculateRAtios
DisplayDataOnImage
DisplayHistogram
DisplayMeasurement

--Bugfixes
MeasureObjectAreaShape to deal with zero objects
Minor bugfix in Align.m
Minor bugfix in DisplayHistogram.m
Modules Help "off by one" bug fixed
Outlines on IdentifyPrimLoG can now be overlaid

--Known Bugs
If MeasureTexture is used on an empty image, it records a single object with all zero features, even though the number of objects recorded in the image data is zero.
The ExportDatabase DataTool does not work (the ExportToDatabase module does, though).


Internal/Programming Changes
How measurements are stored was overhauled for this version.

All modules that record measurements should use the subfunction CPaddmeasurements.  Typical usage is: 
      handles = CPaddmeasurements(handles, ObjectName, FeatureName, Data);

This will create or add to the data structure:
	handles.Measurements.(ObjectName).(FeatureName
See CPaddmeasurements for more details and optional arguments.

Individual features are now stored in separate substructures of the handles.Measurements.ObjectName structure.  

Perusing the CP_convert_old_measurements.m code may be illuminating.  This function updates the previous measurement structure to the new style.

Consider whether measurements you are storing will overwrite each other if more than one of the same module is placed in the pipeline.  Features may need more specific names to prevent name collision.

The Data Tools should be able to parse measurement files from the previous version of CellProfiler.  Please let us know if this does not work.

The placeholder text for variable boxes indicating that an entry is to be ignored or that nothing is currently entered varied from "/", "Do not save", "Leave this blank", among others. It has now been standardized to "Do not use"

Version 1.0.4942
- MeasureObjectAreaShape:Zernike optimization: 30% - 50% reduced computation time.
- MeasureImageSaturationBlur: added two more measurements: PercentMaximal and LocalFocusScore (actually NormVar of Local NormVariances).

- CPrelateobjects: add features even when objects are missing.
- CPthreshold: Bugfix: a couple wv -> soe in SumOfEntropies subfunction.
