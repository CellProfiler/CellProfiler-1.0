function m = CPnanmedian(x)
%CPNANMEDIAN Median value, ignoring NaNs.
%   M = CPNANMEDIAN(X) returns the sample median of X, treating NaNs as
%   missing values.  For vector input, M is the median value of the non-NaN
%   elements in X.  For matrix input, M is a row vector containing the
%   median value of non-NaN elements in each column.
%
%   This function will need rewriting if it needs to take medians
%   along any dimension other than the first.  Also, it only accepts
%   vectors and 2D matrices at this time.
