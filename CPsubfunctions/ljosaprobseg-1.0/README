This package contains an implementation of Ljosa and Singh's
probabilistic segmentation algorithm, described in the following
paper:

    Vebjorn Ljosa and Ambuj K. Singh: "Probabilistic Segmentation and
    Analysis of Horizontal Cells," in Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE
    International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), December, 2006,
    doi:10.1109/ICDM.2006.129.

The program is written in C, and simulates a random walk on the image.
We also have an eigenvector-based solution, but that is not included
in this package at this time.  We may incorporate it in the future.

Just typing "make" should build the stand-alone program
"ljosaprobsegsim" as well as a Matlab MEX module called
"ljosaprobseg".  The stand-along program can, for instance, be invoked
as follows:

   ./ljosaprobsegsim -o output.pgm -n 2 -8 -r 0.0001 7cap33x.pgm \
   5000 206,467 207,467 206,468

Do "./ljosaprobsegsim -h" to learn about the available options.  Type
"help ljosaprobseg" in Matlab to learn how to invoke the Matlab
module, or see the example in demo_ljosaprobseg.m.

The programs are multithreaded in order to improve their running time
on machines with multiple processors or cores.  For the stand-alone
program, use the "-n" option to specify the number of worker threads.
The Matlab module is hardcoded to use two worker threads.  (This can
easily be changed in the source code, if desired.)

The software is released under the BSD license.  See the file LICENSE
for details.
