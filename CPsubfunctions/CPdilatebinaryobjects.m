function OutputImage = CPdilatebinaryobjects(InputImage, NumericalObjectDilationRadius)

% This filter acts as if we had dilated each object by a certain number of
% pixels prior to making the projection. It is faster to do this
% convolution when the entire projection is completed rather than dilating
% each object as each image is processed.
