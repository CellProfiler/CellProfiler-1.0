% function IlluminationField = CPcalc_illum_corrxn(Samples, Locations, SmoothingRadius, NumberOfComponents, ImageSize, ShowComputation)
%
% This function calculates the illumination correction images given
% randomly sampled pixels (in SAMPLES, NxK where K is number of
% channels) and their locations within the image (in LOCATIONS, Nx2).
% SmoothingRadius determines how smooth the bias field is
% (essentially, a Gaussian filter applied to the Illumination
% function.  NumberOfComponents determined how many different pixel
% classes there are (e.g., nuclei, cell, background).  ImageSize gives
% the size of the images the data were taken from.
%
% The method is essentially that given in "Adaptive segmentation of
% MRI data", Wells et al., 1996, except we don't have the class
% distributions.  So we mix estimation of the class distributions and
% the bias field in alternating EM steps.
