Module #1: LoadImages revision - 3
     How do you want to load these files?    Text-Exact match
     Type the text that one type of image has in common (for TEXT options), or their position in each group (for ORDER option):    Channel 1-01-A-01-00.tif
     What do you want to call these images within CellProfiler?    OrigCytoplasm
     Type the text that one type of image has in common (for TEXT options), or their position in each group (for ORDER option). Type "Do not use" to ignore:    Channel 2-01-A-01-00.tif
     What do you want to call these images within CellProfiler? (Type "Do not use" to ignore)    OrigDNA
     Type the text that one type of image has in common (for TEXT options), or their position in each group (for ORDER option):    Do not use
     What do you want to call these images within CellProfiler?    Do not use
     Type the text that one type of image has in common (for TEXT options), or their position in each group (for ORDER option):    Do not use
     What do you want to call these images within CellProfiler?    Do not use
     If using ORDER, how many images are there in each group (i.e. each field of view)?    3
     What type of files are you loading?    individual images
     Analyze all subfolders within the selected folder?    No
     Enter the path name to the folder where the images to be loaded are located. Type period (.) for default image folder.    .
     If the images you are loading are binary (black/white only), in what format do you want to store them?    grayscale
     Note - If the movies contain more than just one image type (e.g., brightfield, fluorescent, field-of-view), add the GroupMovieFrames module.    n/a

Module #2: SmoothOrEnhance revision - 4
     What did you call the image to be smoothed?    OrigDNA
     What do you want to call the smoothed image?    SmoothedDNA
     Enter the smoothing method you would like to use.    Gaussian Filter
     If you choose any setting besides 'Fit Polynomial' as your smoothing method, please specify the approximate width of the objects in your image (in pixels). This will be used to calculate an adequate filter size. If you don't know the width of your objects, you can use the ShowOrHidePixelData image tool to find out or leave the word 'Automatic'.    20
     If you want to use your own filter size (in pixels), please specify it here. Otherwise, leave "Do not use". If you entered a width for the previous variable, this will override it.    Do not use
     Are you using this module to smooth an image that results from processing multiple cycles?  (If so, this module will wait until it sees a flag that the other module has completed its calculations before smoothing is performed).    No

Module #3: IdentifyPrimAutomatic revision - 12
     What did you call the images you want to process?    OrigCytoplasm
     What do you want to call the objects identified by this module?    Nuclei
     Typical diameter of objects, in pixel units (Min,Max):    10,40
     Discard objects outside the diameter range?    Yes
     Try to merge too small objects with nearby larger objects?    No
     Discard objects touching the border of the image?    Yes
     Select an automatic thresholding method or enter an absolute threshold in the range [0,1].  To choose a binary image, select "Other" and type its name.  Choosing 'All' will use the Otsu Global method to calculate a single threshold for the entire image group. The other methods calculate a threshold for each image individually. "Set interactively" will allow you to manually adjust the threshold during the first cycle to determine what will work well.    Otsu Global
     Threshold correction factor    1
     Lower and upper bounds on threshold, in the range [0,1]    0,1
     For MoG thresholding, what is the approximate fraction of image covered by objects?    0.01
     Method to distinguish clumped objects (see help for details):    Intensity
      Method to draw dividing lines between clumped objects (see help for details):    Intensity
     Size of smoothing filter, in pixel units (if you are distinguishing between clumped objects). Enter 0 for low resolution images with small objects (~< 5 pixel diameter) to prevent any image smoothing.    Automatic
     Suppress local maxima within this distance, (a positive integer, in pixel units) (if you are distinguishing between clumped objects)    Automatic
     Speed up by using lower-resolution image to find local maxima?  (if you are distinguishing between clumped objects)    Yes
     Enter the following information, separated by commas, if you would like to use the Laplacian of Gaussian method for identifying objects instead of using the above settings: Size of neighborhood(height,width),Sigma,Minimum Area,Size for Wiener Filter(height,width),Threshold    Do not use
     What do you want to call the outlines of the identified objects (optional)?    Do not use
     Do you want to fill holes in identified objects?    Yes
     Do you want to run in test mode where each method for distinguishing clumped objects is compared?    No

Module #4: MeasureObjectIntensity revision - 2
     What did you call the greyscale images you want to measure?    OrigCytoplasm
     What did you call the objects that you want to measure?    Nuclei
        Do not use
        Do not use
        Do not use
        Do not use
        Do not use
